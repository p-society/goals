# Goals of the Programming Society

This repo triages various issues listing possible measures that can be or are being undertaken for the advancement of the developer community here at IIIT-Bh.

## Motivation

[Shibasis Patel](https://github.com/shibasisp) started a slack team in the summers of 2017 in order to establish a developer community at IIIT-Bh. The team was extremely active for the first 3-4 months or so with 100s of messages everyday but as the new semester started the interaction between the members started decreasing and by the end of 2017 the community was almost dormant with only 5-6 members posting a few links and mostly chatting in DMs.

Instead of taking advantage of this community and taking it to the next level, we decided to keep our software development activities to ourselves which was not desirable at all, since computer science and programming is all about learning from the community and then giving back to the community.

So sometime during 2018 even semester one of us (the author of this document) decided to rant about the decline of user traffic on our slack team and also the almost non-existing interaction from the first year batch (2017-21) at the time. This voice was heard by the members of the community and what happened after that was absolutely heartwarming and encouraging.

People responded to that message even the first years and the community become active again. Members were interacting with each other and everyone took it upon themselves to keep the team active. Another great thing in the midst of all this, the author was able to convince our web dev ninja [Kautilya Tripathi](https://github.com/knrt10) to join the team. The author considers this his biggest achievment by far since **knrt10** ~~used to be~~ is one stubborn individual and also used to act like a lone wolf developer.

Kautilya brought to the team his experience and wisdom and quickly become one of the most active members of the team by mentoring the first years and kickstarting our projects. And soon our very first [project](https://github.com/p-society/typeracer-cli) hit a 100 stars on Github.

## Aim

This repo is used to keep a record of all the tasks/initiatives/projects *currently/to be* undertaken by the programming society.

An issue can be starting a new community chapter related to a specific domain of CS or a project (by that I mean writing some kind of software) that might help the whole college.

This is one of our busiest repos with regular discussions taking place on various issue threads.

## Contributing

We encourage all our members be it a 1st year or a 4th year to contribute their ideas in form of issues or by taking part in ongoing conversations on existing issue threads.
